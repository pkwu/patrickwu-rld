          My pursuit as a software engineer began in 2012. I started with a visual learning language, and worked my way up until I was capable of being a lab assistant for the course. I proceeded to learn Python, Java, and C++, but found myself confused about unique personalities in my classes. I sought out a concentration in Cognitive Science, before finishing undergrad and eventually resuming my pursuit of knowledge in Computer Science. Since then, I've developed a desire to provide satisfactory UI/UX via web applications. I have a niche for being cognizant of the user experience, and find great satisfaction in providing sufficient website ammenities.
